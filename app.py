@app.get('/')
def hello_world():
    '''
    The root route which returns a JSON response.

    The JSON response is delivered as:

    {
      'message': 'Hello, World!'
    }
    '''
    return {'message': 'Hello, World!'}

@app.get('/healthcheck', status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
def perform_healthcheck():
    '''
    Simple route for the GitHub Actions to perform healthchecks on.

    More info is available at:
    https://github.com/akhileshns/heroku-deploy#health-check

    It basically sends a GET request to the route & hopes to get a "200"
    response code. Failing to return a 200 response code just enables
    the GitHub Actions to rollback to the last version the project was
    found in a "working condition". It acts as a last line of defense in
    case something goes south.

    Additionally, it also returns a JSON response in the form of:

    {
      'healtcheck': 'Everything OK!'
    }
    '''
    return {'healthcheck': 'Everything OK!'}
